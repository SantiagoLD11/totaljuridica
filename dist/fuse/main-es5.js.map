But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no\\n    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\\n</p>\\n'\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n","export class MailFakeDb\r\n{\r\n    public static mails = [\r\n        {\r\n            'id'            : '15459251a6d6b397565',\r\n            'from'          : {\r\n                'name'  : 'Alice Freeman',\r\n                'avatar': 'assets/images/avatars/alice.jpg',\r\n                'email' : 'alicefreeman@creapond.com'\r\n            },\r\n            'to'            : [\r\n                {\r\n                    'name' : 'me',\r\n                    'email': 'johndoe@creapond.com'\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            'subject'       : 'Commits that need to be pushed lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.',\r\n            'message'       : '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
